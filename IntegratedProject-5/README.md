## ðŸš€ Project Objectives  

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean and standardize the dataset (e.g., lowercase column names, convert data types).  
   - Handle missing values and invalid entries (e.g., `TBD`).  
   - Add a new column for total global sales.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze release trends across years and platforms.  
   - Identify leading platforms and genres globally and regionally.  
   - Explore the impact of user/critic reviews and ESRB ratings on sales.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   - Test if average user ratings of Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.  
   - Test if average user ratings for Action and Sports genres differ.  

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:  
   - Summarize findings to guide advertising and product planning strategies.
